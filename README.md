# IoT-based-smart-waste-management-system
A smart bin that is able to send real-time data of the waste level which controls overflow of the waste outside the bin; thus maintains sustainable environment. 
The system contains more IoT features following SDG goals Using Arduino Uno and Blynk Application.

Note: This project was done for our Integrated Design Project course, therefore the report is written in the company perspective. Our decision-making determined the project's whole scope, and the Arduino codes represent the project's final product.
